            <h2>A Quick Bio</h2>
            <p>Heyo! I'm Robert Casabianca, but you can call me Bobby. I'm currently taking 235 due to my major, that being Game Design and Development. <br>
                My main hope for this class is that it'll help me learn how to code in html and in turn help me make websites (which it already has!). <br>
                It is, as of Fall of 2023, my second year here at RIT and it's been fun. A big highlight of my time at RIT is participating in clubs on campus, like WADAIKO. <br>
                I hope that by the time I graduate in two more years that I'll be fluent in multiple coding languages
                and that I'll have the skills to make amazing games that people can enjoy for years to come. <br>
                Striving away from all the school related stuff, my main interests outside of class involve playing games, dnd, rock music, writing stories, and eating sandwiches. <br>
                My current goal right now is to balance studying and relaxing during the school year.
