        <h2>'Til The Very Bookend</h2>
        <h3>High Concept</h3>
        <p>Fight through enemies to reach your favorite book and try to make it out in one piece.</p>
        <h3>Genre</h3>
        <p>Adventure, Shooter</p>
        <h3>Platform</h3>
        <p>Desktop web</p>
        <h3>Story</h3>
        <P> You play as Laslow the Magus, who is a bit obsessed with collecting books and tomes. He hears of 
            a super rare edition of his favorite novel, "Troglodyte's Guide to Book Collecting", and needs to get his hands 
            on it immediately. The only issue, the book is guarded by a lot of sentinels and Laslow will have to fight or avoid them 
            in order to get his desired book.
        </P>
        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
        <p> The graphic style, for both visuals and sound, will most likely resemble 8-bit games (less detail, but 
            can still tell what things are meant to be).
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p> The gameplay will be moving around the play area space by space using WASD and using 
            the C key to pick up items. WASD and Space will be used during combat to move and attack respectively. 
            The player will be told these controls at the start screen. The first combat will be unavoidable, but will be 
            easier than the others to ease the player in.
        </p>

            <h3>Other</h3>
            <p> Nothing else of note to mention yet. I don't plan on using any external libraries at the current moment.</p>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> My name is Robert Casabianca, but you can call me Bobby. My major is in Game Design and Development and I am in my 2nd year
                as of Fall of 2023. In terms of game design, I have more experience and skill in enemy and level design. I prefer to stick to programming, 
                but I can make basic graphics when needed.

        <h2>Documentation Section</h2>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            The process used during the creation of this game involved a lot of trial and error. I would implement a new function or idea, it would fail, 
            and then I would go on and fix it or scrap it. I also divided my creation process into goals to make my efforts more efficient. My first goal 
            was to finish up the world part of the game. I focused heavily on the collision and pickup systems to ensure that they worked properly. My next goal 
            was to finish the battle section, which also involved collisions, but also needed to have a system for projectiles moving. The final goal was local storage 
            and how it would connect the world and battle parts of the game. This mainly came down to preserving positions and allowing certain powers to be used.
        </p>
        <h3>Sources</h3>
        <p>
            All sprites and music were created by me. The sprites were made using <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel</a> 
            and the music and sounds were made using <a href="https://www.noteflight.com/home/myScores">Noteflight</a> (sorry if the link doesn't work 
            I could only get the myScores section of the website due to being signed in).
            <br>
            The font used in game was <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playball?query=playball">Playball. The font used in documentation
            was <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif?query=bree">Bree Serif</a>.
            </a>
            <br>
            I also used DOM Adventure! as the baseline of my code. The player movement (just the up down left and right), the cell creation, 
            and other parts in the javascript came from Adventure!. I made a large amount of alterations to this base code and not many remnants 
            from Adventure! remain unchanged.
        </p>
        <h3>Special</h3>
        <p>There is nothing special that is needed to be pointed out. Everything you can see while playing is what you need to see.</p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            I am going to use the rubric found in Project 3 - Final Code Submission to mark down each requirement.
            <br>
            ES6 Class: ES6 classes were created and used in world.js, they were not used in battle.js due to them breaking my code.
            <br>
            Validation: All css and html are valid.
            <br>
            Errors: No errors break the flow of gameplay and from what I can see, none appear in the console. Sometimes the bullets in the battle 
            section will freeze in place after colliding with an enemy, but that doesn't break anything and is a visual bug.
            <br>
            Images: The images are optimized and look good during gameplay.
            <br>
            Proposal: It was submitted in time.
            <br>
            Critique: My prototype was present in class and was critiqued in class. The rubric says something about Slack, but I'm pretty sure 
            the in-person critique day counts as well.
            <br>
            Code: The code is formatted well and is well commented.
            <br>
            Console: The console is clean during gameplay.
            <br>
            Above and Beyond: I believe that my implementation of sound, timed movement, and the creation of two games in one 
            makes my efforts go above and beyond the basic requirements of this project. Sound was required, but I made sure that every 
            aspect of my game has sound associated with it (except for simple movement). The movement is also based on time and not on
            player input, which is how it was in DOM Adventure!. I also made two games instead of one, with the games being split between the world 
            and battle sections of Til The Very Bookend.
