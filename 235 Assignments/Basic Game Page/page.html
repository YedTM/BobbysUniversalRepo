        <h2>Description</h2>

        <blockquote>
            <p><em>Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin</em> is a remastered release of Dark Souls II. Next to the main game with all patches includes the three DLC packs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dark Souls II: Crown of the Sunken King</li>
                <li>Dark Souls II: Crown of the Old Iron King</li>
                <li>Dark Souls II: Crown of the Ivory King</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The gameplay has been slightly changed by removing certain safe zones and adding new NPCs and enemies, including the Forlorn.<br>
                The placing of enemies have been changed to create a whole new game dynamic, specifically for returning players. <br>
                Online and the campaign have had game balance tweaks, improved online matchmaking, better quality graphics and different item descriptions. <br>
                The PC (DirectX 11), PS4 and Xbox One version have additional upgrades to graphics, sound, and performance. For those platforms online gameplay has also been changed from 4 to supporting 6 players.
