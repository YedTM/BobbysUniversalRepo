        <h2>Documentation for Phase One</h2>
        <p><a href="src/buzz.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see the source image</a></p>
        <p><a href="spec.html" target="_blank">Click here to visit the recreation (spec.html)</a></p>
        <p>Two of the images in spec.html (The man with the spider and the set of images above the Keep section) come from the above pdf</p>
        <p>The picture of the PDA (The rotated device next to the Keep section) can be found here: 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ae/Xircom-Rex-3-DS-Organizer-Docking/dp/B00000J58C" target="_blank">Image here!</a>
        </p>
        <p>The fonts used were: 
            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans?preview.text=This%20is%20for%20the%20paragraphs&preview.size=48&query=noto+sans" target="_blank">Noto-Sans</a>
            and
            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend?preview.text=This%20is%20for%20the%20headings&preview.size=48&stroke=Sans+Serif&query=lexend" target="_blank" id="lexend">Lexend</a>
        </p>
        <p>Only one other resource was utilized and that was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>, 
            which helped when I couldn't recall the correct way to code certain things (ex. the indentation in the Keep section)
        </p>
        <div id="layoutOne">
            <img src="src/phase_one_layout.jpg" alt="The drawn layout of phase one" width="400" height="530"> 
            <p>This is the drawn layout of Phase 1</p>
        </div>
        <div id="layoutTwo">
            <img src="src/responsive_design_phase_one.jpg" alt="The drawn layout of a responsive phase one" width="400" height="530"> 
            <p>This is the drawn layout of a responsive Phase 1</p>
        </div>
        <div id="textBelow">
            <p>The goal of this site (that being spec.html) is to recreate the article in the pdf. It aimed to copy the layout, font, and colors.</p>
            <p>The audience I would assume is my teacher, his TA, and potentially my fellow classmates. 
                This made me work extra hard at copying the article, because I want it to look nice for the people viewing it.
            </p>
            <p>There is only one thing I'd like to point out about the project and that is the indentation
                of the text in column one of the Keep section. The code is a bit jarring, but that was the only way
                I could get the indentation to look and work properly. Sorry in advance if you see it and its a bit jarring.
            </p>

        <h2>Documentation for Phase Two</h2>

        <p>All images except for the top Bounty Hunter image come from Darkest Dungeon II directly or from the 
            <a href="https://darkestdungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Darkest_Dungeon_II#Heroes" target="_blank"> Darkest Dungeon Wiki</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The top Bounty Hunter image comes from 
            <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2-is-overhauling-progression-and-adding-bounty-hunters-next" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The information summarized in the Backstory, Skills, and Description sections came 
            from Darkest Dungeon II and from the <a href="https://darkestdungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Darkest_Dungeon_II#Heroes" target="_blank"> Darkest Dungeon Wiki</a>.
        </p>
        <p>For the responsive design of Phase 2, I used the Phone layout found in Phase 1's documentation. I decided to avoid using the Tablet format as 
            I felt that it would take up too much time that could have been used for other things.
        </p>
        <p>The same fonts and resources from Phase 1 were used in Phase 2.</p>
            <p>The intended audience for this website is beginners to Darkest Dungeon II and normal Darkest Dungeon II players. 
                The information present on the page allows beginners to get a feel for all of the characters and allows normal 
                players to revisit the lore of their favorite characters and see how I view all of the characters personally.
            </p>
            <p>The only thing I can really point to as being notable on my page is that I was able to get a drop down menu to 
                replace the previous navigation bar when my page goes from desktop view to phone view. I'm happy with the way it came out.
            </p>
            <p>The only bad thing I can point out currently is that during validation there are a lot of warnings for not having headings, but 
                I personally don't think they're needed where the validator says they should be. It really wants headings to be placed at the start 
                of every section, despite most not needing them and the sections being there for semantic purposes. Other than that I can't think 
                of much wrong with the page off the top of my head. I hope you enjoyed viewing it.
