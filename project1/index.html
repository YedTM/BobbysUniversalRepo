                    <h4>"Indiscriminate science stains the surgeon's hands."</h4>
                    <p> The Plague Doctor, real name Paracelsus, was an academic who had an uncanny focus on the life and death of all things, especially people. 
                        Her unconventional theories brought the ire of her classmates and professor, who would mock and jeer at Paracelsus. She would come to debate
                        her professor regarding the blandness and useless lecture, but despite her best efforts she was unable to win over the opinion of her professor 
                        or her classmates. One day she finds the professor slumped over the lecture podium and eager to prove her theories and having a fresh cadaver
                        she proceeded to demonstrate her abilities in front of her class. She had successfully taken apart and reanimated the dead professor, but in doing
                        so she terrified her classmates, whose screams still reverberate within her mind.

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Plague Doctor's skills do relatively low initial damage, but she excels in damage over time. This combined with her 
                        ability to heal and remove damage over time effects on her allies make her a great support hero. Her main downside is her inability to heal her teamates 
                        during long battles, so another healer might be needed when using her base skills.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Plague Doctor excels in ranks 3 and 4, so pairing her up with other front ranks is a good idea. I would personally 
                        have The Leper on a team with her, since he can greatly utilize the increased RES that the Plague Doctor offers. Teaming her with a main healer 
                        like The Vestal or The Occultist can make up for her lack of healing in the long term.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Plague Doctor is a great character all around character who succeeds in most things. She can provide a large amount
                        of damage over time, while providing support with her Ounce of Prevention skill. Her ability to remove Blight, Burn, and Bleed makes her a great utility since 
                        she is the only hero able to do this. However, I would avoid relying on her solely for healing.

                    <h1>The Grave Robber</h1>
                    <h4>"Avarice slips unseen into the catacombs of the mind."</h4>
                    <p> The Grave Robber, real name Audrey, was born rich and married even richer. Despite the joys that wealth brings, it was not worth
                        what her husband did to her. Years of abuse had been levied against her, but that all ended when her husband died. Although the 
                        abuse may have ended, the riches soon did too due to the debt that her husband had accrued during his life. As she wandered the empty halls 
                        of her manor, she saw a portrait of her husband with a hand full of golden rings. Seeing this, she rushed to the graveyard and begun to plunder.
                        When armed officials arrived to her manor to evict her, they only found dirt, leaves, and the riches of the dead. They could not find Audrey...

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Grave Robber's starting skills do high damage and ignore a lot of the benefits that enemies can 
                        give themselves. All of her skills are usuable in rank 2 and allow her to attack multiple enemies and bypass defenses with Blight.
                        Her ability to heal herself 3 times while giving herself Dodge is amazing and a great utility.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Grave Robber excels in two kinds of teams in my opinion. The first being a Dance Team, that being a team 
                        that consists of heroes that can use their abilities in all ranks and move around ranks often. The second being a team with a tank, like The 
                        Flagellant or The Leper. Although she can keep herself safe, she benefits greatly by having a team member that can take all the enemies' attention.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Grave Robber is a very good character who can easily deal with enemies that love to buff themselves before 
                        attacking. She has good self-sustainability and great damage, but I do dislike one of her skills. Flashing Daggers does too little damage, even 
                        if it can attack multiple enemies. Still, she is a great hero that works well in most situations.

                    <h4>"Hunted, hurried, a fugitive seeking to outpace the past."</h4>
                    <p> The Highwayman, real name Dismas, was a prisoner. Keyword was, since he broke out of prison during a prison riot in order to gain his freedom. 
                        Freedom was not as great as he once thought, for now he began to grow sick and starved whilst living with rats in the canals of the city. Needing food, 
                        money, and really anything at all, Dismas took a job from an unscrupulous malefactor, which would be his final heist. He effortlessly robbed and stagecoach and killed 
                        all that was in it. Unknowingly, he had killed a woman and her child, which mortified him. Dismas could outrun his pursuers and escape any prison, except for his guilt...

                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Highwayman's skills excel in damage and lethality. Wicked Slice does high damage and can ensure the death of enemies with its 
                        Death's Door piercing. The ability to gain Riposte allows for constant damage, even when its not his turn. Take Aim is the best of his abilities, since it grants 
                        him guaranteed Crit and Dodge, which improves his lethality and survivability.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Highwayman excels in teams that can boost his damage or make enemies vulnerable. Heroes like The Flagellant and The 
                        Occultist work perfectly with The Highwayman. He can also work well in Dance Teams since his abilites let him move around ranks with ease and attack in 
                        all of them without losing a lot of damage potential.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Highwayman is one of my favorite heroes in the game. An upgraded version of Take Aim, along with skills he gains later 
                        on in the game, makes him a killing machine that can rarely be hit. His ability to avoid damage completely allows his other teammates to focus on damage or healing 
                        other allies. His damage output is unparalled and is an amazing pick for any team.

                    <h1>The Man-At-Arms</h1>
                    <h4>Pride - more devastating than the horrors of a hundred campaigns."</h4>
                    <p> The Man-at-Arms, real name Barristan, was a military officer who rose up the ranks in the military, not through battle, but through influence and intimidation. His 
                        pride overwhelmed him once he realized he would be able to command a legion of soldiers into victory. His pride was unfounded and it led to mass confusion and failure 
                        when it came time for real combat. His entire regiment had died due to his faulty commands, but he alone survived with one eye remaining. Wracked with survivor's guilt, Barristan 
                        would scream and cry whilst in the field hospital while be haunted by spectres of his soldiers. Eventually he would return to the place of his failure and attempt to make 
                        ammends for his regiment and try to bring them peace. Now, Barristan roams from battlefield to battlefield seeking atonement and eventually the death he believes he deserves.

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Man-at-Arms' starting skills focuses on defending allies more than dealing damage. Defender and Hold the Line draw in attacks from 
                        enemies and provides Guarded to allies who may be low on health and in need of help. The ability to remove stress is a very strong asset to have due to how lethal 
                        it can be. His damage isn't something to scoff at either, but I believe his damage is outweighed by his support abilities.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Man-at-Arms can be used in two ways: Full Frontal and Support. If you want him to focus on dealing as much damage as possible, then 
                        him being in rank 1 is the way to go. If you want to use him as support you can place him in any rank since most of his support skills work in all ranks. His best 
                        teammates would most likely be frail heroes like The Runaway and The Occultist due to their low starting HP. He can also work well with other damage dealers due to 
                        his ability to grant Strength using an acquired skill.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Man-at-Arms isn't my favorite by a long shot, but I can't deny that he has his uses. Defending allies directly has its uses, but can 
                        result in situations where other allies are left defenseless and can even result in a premature death for the Man-at-Arms. His damage isn't as good as other front liners 
                        in my opinion and there are better front line tanks than him as well. I would rather choose other heroes than the Man-at-Arms in most scenarios.

                    <h4>"Beneath the bloodlust and fury, there is emptiness... and shame."</h4>
                    <p> The Hellion, real name Boudica, comes from a tribe of warriors who yearn for battle and believe that a warrior's death is the 
                        proper way to die. Boudica was young when she joined the warband, but she was eager to help her people in the heat of battle. Despite her initial 
                        enthusiasm, when it came time to fight she was overrun with fear and ran from the battle, leaving her warband for death. As the enemy army left the battle she 
                        saw in the scavengers, that were eating her kin, herself. She returned to her people, but was shunned for avoiding a warrior's death and leaving her kin to die. 
                        She was then exiled. Now she wanders the countryside whilst fighting and yearning for a warrior's death, but alas it would never find her...

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Hellion's skills are all about being in the front ranks and applying as much damage as possible. Wicked Hack and Iron Swan 
                        deal massive damage to rank 1 and 4 respectively and Toe to Toe makes sure she stays in rank 1 as long as possible. However, her skill Barbaric YAWP! is a 
                        bit lackluster and gives her Winded, which reduces her damage by 33%. This is not worth it in my opinion and shouldn't be used.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Hellion works with heroes who prefer to stay in the back ranks, like The Plague Doctor and The Occultist. She gains a 
                        large damage boost at lower HP states and can benefit from receiving heals less often than most other heroes. There is one hero I would recommend avoiding and 
                        that would be The Leper, since both heavily rely on being in rank 1 and 2 for most of the fight.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Hellion is one of my favorite heroes for damage in Darkest Dungeon II. Her abilities allow her to deal a huge amount of sustained 
                        damage and she works very well with a tank who can take hits when she hits low health. She also has the ability to apply bleed if she can't hit through the armor of 
                        the enemies, which lends to her lethality even more. She's a great offensive hero and an amazing pick for a rank 1 hero.

                    <h4>"Nothing remains... save a burning will to survive."</h4>
                    <p> The Runaway, real name Bonnie, was an orphan at a terrible orphanage known as Saint Martha's. She would escape the 
                        orphanage by stealing the keys from one of the caretakers, but took several hits from the caretaker's branding iron 
                        in the process. She would roam from place to place until a kind woodsman and his wife welcomed her into their home, 
                        where she warmed herself in the warmth of the fire and hearts of her new caregivers. She would stay up late tending 
                        the fire of the home and would be capitivated by its alive-like movements. She would then start throwing things into 
                        the fire, which resulted in an blaze she could no longer control. She was fixated by the beauty of the flame, but fled 
                        the house when a beam fell from the ceiling and frightened her. Her adoptive parents did not escape from the cabin that 
                        night...

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Runaway's starting skills are odd in that she provides good damage and damage over time, but 
                        also provides small support to her allies. She can make her self unable to be targeted by attacks by using Run and Hide, but can 
                        allow her allies to attack enemies who use the same tactic with Hearthlight. Her best ability is her Searing Strike as it provides 
                        a great initial hit of damage followed by Burn.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Runaway works well with teams that can benefit from her ability to apply Burn and Combo. 
                        The Leper benefits greatly through the Runaway's application of Combo and can defend her from enemy attacks. She also has a good synergy 
                        with The Occultist due to a skill she gets later on that allows her to remove Bleed that The Occultist may apply.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Runaway falls into a similar role that The Plague Doctor fills, but focuses more on damage than support. 
                        The Runaway has ways to aid her team through healing (acquired later on) and blinding enemies to avoid them from hitting allies. However, her 
                        initial damage and damage over time effects make her an effective offensive hero that can ensure the enemy burns to a crisp.

                    <p> The Jester, real name Sarmenti, was once a layabout busking on street corners for a pitiful amount of coinage. After being 
                        ushered away from the commerical blocks of the city he heard a melody by a cemetery and searched for its performer. He would 
                        learn this melody from this performer and claim it as his own, regrowing his once dormant ambition. His talent became 
                        so well known that he was summoned to entertain the King and his Court. He anticipated applause and praise, but was met with 
                        ridicule and torture. He eventually played a final song for the King and his Court and that song was the song of the dead. 
                        Sarmenti slaughtered the King and his Court while they were drunk. This drove him to hysterics and in his insanity he cut off 
                        his own finger before drifting down the royal halls, humming a melody he couldn't quite remember...

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Jester's skills excel in applying debuffs to enemies and buffing his teammates while he dances 
                        around the ranks. He can deal good damage with Razor's Wit, Fade to Black, and Slice Off while applying things like Combo, 
                        Blind, and Bleed. He also has great support with skills like Battle Ballad and Inspiring Tune, which grants allies Strength and 
                        decreased Stress. 
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Jester excels in a Dance Team, since many of his starting and non-starting abilities move him 
                        and his allies around the ranks constantly. He works especially well with heroes like The Highwayman and The Grave Robber due to 
                        them benefiting greatly from Blind and Combo. He can also work in normal teams, but he's best left in ranks 2 and 3 in that case.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br>The Jester is an excellent hero who excels in buffing his allies and debilitating his enemies. His 
                        flexibility when it comes to rank placement is unparalled, which allows him to be effective no matter where he is. His damage is 
                        good, his buffs are great, and he is spectacular.

                    <h1>The Leper</h1>
                    <h4>"Making peace with adversity is the very essence of existence."</h4>
                    <p> The Leper, real name Baldwin, was a king who cared greatly for all of those who resided in his kingdom. 
                        He would often visit the sick and dying and attempt to provide what comfort he could, depsite the protests 
                        from his royal advisors, which he viewed as far more repulsive than the sick he comforted. Unfortunately, Baldwin 
                        had gained an affliction that could not be cured by any of the doctors or aides he had at his disposal and it became clear 
                        that he was dying. Whilst bedridden, his advisors schemed and planned to overthrow his reign. Hearing this, Baldwin summoned 
                        his blacksmith and hoisted a blade that would strike down his advisors and their treacherous plans. He would slay his 
                        previous advisors with such a fury that he broke his sword by the end of his purge. He would then abdicate his throne, satisfied 
                        that the spirit of his tenure would endure. As he left his city, his subjects weeped, threw petals at his feet, and watched with 
                        respect and reverance. He was proud, he was grateful for his blessings, and he marveled at the beauty of the world.

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Leper's starting skills are all about being in the front rank and tanking hits while dealing them as well. His main method 
                        of attack is his Chop, which can deal a whopping 6-12 damage, with the downside of blinding The Leper most of the time. The other downside of the Leper is 
                        his attack range, since he can really only attack the first two ranks with his starting skills (he can attack farther later on). The rest of his abilities act 
                        as utility and tanking, with Purge and Reflection falling into utility and Withstand and Solemnity falling into tanking, which all excel at.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Leper is extremely self-sufficient and can act as a damage dealer and tank at the same time, while healing himself when needed. 
                        Due to this, The Leper can work well with most other heroes, just as long as they don't want to be in rank 1. This puts The Leper at odds with mainly The Hellion. 
                        He also doesn't work well with Dance Teams that move to rank 1 in order to succeed in their strategies. Other than those exceptions, The Leper works with nearly everyone.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Leper is another of my favorite heroes in the game due to his pure tankiness and raw power. He hits like a truck and can take hits 
                        better than most other heroes. I consistently swap between him and The Hellion for rank 1 during team creation due to how good they both are. Similar to The Flagellant, 
                        his inability to really die while tanking makes him an invaluable asset on the team and allows other heroes to show their true colors without the worry of taking damage.

                    <h4>"To know the abyss, one must embrace it."</h4>
                    <p> The Occultist, real name Alhazred, would gather his devotees and would send his own spirit out into the void to search for cosmic 
                        and impossible power. One day he had found himself amongst an expanse of sand dunes where he would find a pyramidal temple. He would enter the 
                        temple, set himself upon the dais in its center and prepare himself for sacrifice. He would have to sacrifice his own virtues to attain a greater power. 
                        After doing so he would return to his devotees and would send his spirit out once more, but this time he would happen upon a cosmic entity known as The Shambler. 
                        Using the energy of his devotees, he would slay The Shambler, but in doing so he killed his own devotees. He now has unbelievable eldritch powers, but now an entity 
                        stalks his consciousness and yearns for the moment it can take over.

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Occultist's skills focus heavily on debilitating enemies and staying in the back row. Weakening Curse and the eventual 
                        Vulnerable Hex apply massive debuffs like Weak, Combo, and Vulnerable to allow allies to avoid taking massive amounts of damage and allowing them to deal 
                        a massive amount of damage. His Abyssal Artillery does good damage towards the back two enemies and can apply Combo as well. His most influential skill is 
                        his Wyrd Reconstruction, which has a chance to heal allies to full on a crit or nothing at all. It also has the possible side effect to deal Bleed to allies, but 
                        with the right items, this can be the best healing in the game.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Occultist can work at full capacity in any team and when I say any team I mean any team. The Occultist has damage 
                        for all ranks, but his main purpose is to heal and debuff, which can occur in all ranks. This makes him perfect for Dance Teams and teams that don't move a lot. 
                        Since his healing can be both extremely powerful and very lackluster, it isn't a bad idea to team him up with The Plague Doctor or The Vestal to make up for his 
                        lackluster heals from time to time.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Occultist is my favorite healer and support character in the game. His ability to fully heal allies who are on Death's Door is 
                        simply too good. There is always the chance for him to fail his heal, but 9 times out of 10 he usually succeeds. His debuffs amplify the damage of all of his allies and 
                        improves the tankiness of all of them as well, which is invaluable. His only downside is that he has the lowest HP out of all the heroes, but with the right team he could go 
                        through the entire game not getting hit once.

                    <p> The Vestal, real name Junia, was a sister in The Abbey who tended the Order's flame in order to keep it bright and burning. Her life was sheltered and 
                        any impure thoughts were to be smothered and cast aside. One day while she was meant to tend the flame, she noticed a couple outside in the courtyard, 
                        which distracted her. She let the flame burn out due to her intrigue and was swiftly punished for her blasphemy. After enough punishment, she would 
                        fight back against her torturer. She had gained emancipation and was blessed by the Light and she was eager to share her discovery with her sisters. 
                        When she made it back to the dorms she was met with a freshly made wall, the sisters had been locked in their dorms, which had now become their tomb. 
                        Her punishment was not just torture, but the death of her sisters as well.

                        constant Block or Dodge and her healing is strong enough to sustain a tank, but not multiple allies at once. My preferred tank to pair her with 
                        is The Leper, since he can allow her to focus on damage when he can use Solemnity.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Vestal is a good healer, but not my favorite. Later skills increases her buffing and healing greatly, but at 
                        the beginning she is a bit all over the place. Her Consecration skills are very powerful and it might be worth taking her just for that, but the 
                        high cooldowns on her support skills is a bit off putting for my tastes.

                    <h1>The Flagellant</h1>
                    <h4>"Zealotry—an undying blight upon the soul."</h4>
                    <p> The Flagellant, real name Damian, was a shade of the city and looked like a easy target due to his skeletal build. A pair of drunks 
                        decided to let their frustrations fall upon Damian, but as the blood poured down his head he realized that in pain there was power. 
                        He rose above his assailants and forgave them and soon pledged his life to the clergy. He was there enforcer, dealing out slow deaths and 
                        pain to desenters. His brethren thought his methods were too extreme and casted him out of the clergy. He would then let those consumed by sin 
                        use his body as an instrument of repentance until he nearly died. He then fought Death herself and came out on top. He now wanders, searching 
                        for suffering whilst suffering pain and rot. His own personal Heaven on Earth.

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Flagellant's starting skills provide a large amount of support and damage, whilst having detriments that come along with their benefits. 
                        His main attack, Punish, deals good damage and a good amount Blight and he has the ability to apply Blight from the corpses of his enemies. His healing can be used more 
                        often than most other healers, with the downside of losing 20% HP. Endure is a good Stress heal and gaining Stress is actually a benefit for The Flagellant. Lash's Gift 
                        is an excellent buff, whose downside can be countered by Endure. A later skill, More! MORE!, is the ultimate tanking ability, which provides him self healing from being attacked. 
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Flagellant is flexibile in terms of where he can be placed rank wise. His buffs, heals, and attacks can be used in nearly all ranks 
                        at all times. His tanking ability can completely ignore the need of a healer and he can heal himself with his own buffs as well. The Occultist can work well with The 
                        Flagellant due to his ability to make enemy attacks weaker and his heal being able to sustain The Flagellant when he's at too low health. 
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Flagellant is my all time favorite hero in this game. He serves every purpose you could want and solves every problem he faces. 
                        Need damage? He has skills for that! Need a tank? He has skills for that! Need a healer? He even has skills for that! The Flagellant is the definition of unkillable. 
                        He does have the downside of losing health from a lot of his abilities, but since he can heal himself it is barely noticeable. The Flagellant also comes with two 
                        unique abilities. When his Stress maxes out, he actually gains a buff where his damage is increased and his Blight output is increased. The other unique aspect is that 
                        he can summon a mini-boss that can only appear when he is in the party.

                    <h1>The Bounty Hunter</h1>
                    <h4>"The thrill of the hunt, the promise of payment!"</h4>
                    <p> The Bounty Hunter, real name Tardif, is a man of little story and little emotion. Not much is known about The Bounty Hunter. 
                        It is known that he loves the hunt and loves the riches that come with it. As much said he doesn't have much backstory, but there 
                        is one interesting case which shows his ruthlessness. There was a case where a crime lord placed multiple bounties on Tardif's head, 
                        which greatly angered Tardif. Tardif would then bring all the flyers with his bounty on it to the crime boss and proceeded to kill all 
                        of the crime lord's lackeys and finally the crime lord himself. As a trophy, Tardif took his molars. One does not cross The Bounty Hunter 
                        and live to tell the tale...

                    <h1>My Personal Opinion</h1>
                    <div id="colOne"><p>Skills:<br>The Bounty Hunter's skills are all about lethality and Combo. His Collect Bounty attack can deal more damage than The Leper's main attack 
                        when an enemy has Combo, which he can then reapply on consuming the token. His Marked for Death skill will always give his target Combo and Vulnerable, which ensures 
                        his next will be a painful one. His other skills disorient his enemies and pull them in for the kill.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colTwo"><p>Team Comp:<br>The Bounty Hunter is unique in that he can't actually be chosen from the start. He must be found and 
                        paid for. When his services are paid for, he replaces one of your party members for one location. However, most of skills can be used 
                        in rank 3, so a team that can afford replacing rank 3 would be best for him.
                    </p></div>
                    <div id="colThree"><p>Overall:<br> The Bounty Hunter is a very good hero, whose ability to slay enemies is nearly unparalled. His ability to debilitate his enemies 
                        before hitting them with punishing attacks. The only issue with this hero is that you have to replace one of your heroes on your team with him and he does have 
                        a cost, so he isn't free to use like the other heroes. If you can afford to have him on your team, you definitely should.
