    <h1>Dog Documentation</h1>
    <p>The API used for this project was the <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api/" target="_blank">Dog.API</a></p>
    <p>The font used throughout the entire project is Bree Serif.</p>
    <p>I've had many issues with CORS, which seem to occur due to either not being on a live server 
        or because of the way certain links were formatted. This has been fixed now.
    </p>
    <p>The No Image image was found <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/search/images?k=no+image+available&asset_id=462936689" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The last searched primary breed is kep track of so that the user has the same breed ready to be generated again.</p>
    <p>The three controls include: Two drop downs for the requested breed, one drop down for the amount of images generated, and the last
        allows the user to select images and save them to a favorites page.
    </p>
    <p>I think I got at least a 90 with this project. The layout is kind of basic, but pleasing to the eye and the required 
        amount of controls are present. It does what it is meant to do and I think it does it quite well.
