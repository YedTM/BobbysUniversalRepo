    <h1>Dog Documentation</h1>
    <p>The API used for this project was the <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api/" target="_blank">Dog.API</a></p>
    <p>The font used throughout the entire project is Bree Serif.</p>
    <p>I've had many issues with CORS, which seem to occur due to either not being on a live server 
        or because the dog.api website was open on my browser while my live server was active.
